# TeavanaTeas

Welcome to TeavanaTeas interactive tea selector. View a list of our iced tea blends and choose one to learn more and see if it's a match for your taste! Keep playing until you've viewed them all.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'teavana_teas'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install teavana_teas

## Usage

After you enter the executable file, ./bin/teavana-teas, you will see a Welcome message. After you have read this message, follow the instructions and type in and enter GO. Then you will see a list of teas. Once you have selected a tea from the list, type in and enter the number in front of that tea in the list. You will then see extra information about that tea. From here, you can either enter another tea number, "list" to view the list of teas again, or "exit" if you are finished to exit the program.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
